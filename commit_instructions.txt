Run these commands locally to commit and push the build fixes:

1) Ensure you are at the repo root:
   cd /Users/raymondkinneiii/Documents/augment-projects/recomendacontractor

2) Create a new branch (optional):
   git checkout -b fix/docker-build-node22

3) Stage and commit changes:
   git add Dockerfile package.json
   git commit -m "build: use Node 22 in builder, skip Prisma postinstall generate, and build with svelte-kit"

4) Push the branch and open a PR (or push to main if you prefer):
   git push -u origin fix/docker-build-node22

5) Merge to main. The GitHub Action "Build & Deploy to Cloud Run (WIF)" will trigger automatically.

If you prefer to push directly to main:
   git add Dockerfile package.json
   git commit -m "build: use Node 22 in builder, skip Prisma postinstall generate, and build with svelte-kit"
   git push origin main
