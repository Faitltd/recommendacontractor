# Version Control Guidelines

## Commit Practices
- Commit changes every 15-20 minutes during development
- Use descriptive commit messages following conventional commits
- Create feature branches for all new functionality
- Never work on uncommitted changes

## Branch Management
- Create new branches for each feature/fix
- Use descriptive branch names (feature/add-user-auth)
- Keep branches focused on single features
- Merge only after testing and review
